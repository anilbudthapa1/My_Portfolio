          <h2>Sysmon as a Strategic Sensor for SOC Operations</h2>
          <p>
            Modern intrusions do not happen in a single step. They unfold as a chain of actions:
            initial execution, privilege escalation, persistence, lateral movement, and finally
            impact or data exfiltration. Default Windows logging rarely provides enough fidelity
            to reconstruct this chain with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sysmon (System Monitor)</strong> fills this gap by producing rich, high-signal
            telemetry that maps directly to attacker techniques. When properly configured and
            operationalised in a SOC, Sysmon transforms endpoint logs into actionable evidence
            for detection engineering and incident response.

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">Execution & Initial Access</div>
          <h2>Execution & Initial Access: Establishing the First Footprint</h2>
          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 1 – ProcessCreate</span></h3>
          <p>
            Logs every new process execution, including command-line arguments. This event is the
            primary starting point for endpoint investigations and enables SOC analysts to build
            a precise execution timeline, identify LOLBins, and detect suspicious tooling such as
            <code>powershell.exe</code>, <code>certutil.exe</code>, or <code>mshta.exe</code>.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 7 – ImageLoad</span></h3>
          <p>
            Captures DLL loading activity. Attackers frequently leverage DLL hijacking and
            injection to execute payloads in the context of trusted processes. Event 7 provides
            visibility into unusual or unsigned DLLs and abuse of living-off-the-land binaries.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 3 – NetworkConnect</span></h3>
          <p>
            Records outbound network connections with process context. Correlating Event 3 with
            Event 1 allows SOC teams to answer a critical question: <strong>“Which process initiated
            this connection to this IP or domain?”</strong> This is essential for detecting
            command-and-control (C2) traffic and malicious downloads.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation</div>
          <h2>Lateral Movement & Privilege Escalation: Detecting Post-Exploitation Activity</h2>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 8 – CreateRemoteThread</span></h3>
          <p>
            Indicates remote thread creation, a classic memory-injection technique used by many
            post-exploitation frameworks including Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. This event is
            a high-value signal for detecting process injection and stealthy lateral movement.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 10 – ProcessAccess</span></h3>
          <p>
            Monitors access to other processes, including sensitive ones such as
            <code>lsass.exe</code>. Abnormal access patterns here often correspond to credential
            theft attempts using tools like Mimikatz. Properly tuned alerts on Event 10 can
            provide early warning of privilege escalation and credential harvesting.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">Persistence & Configuration Abuse</div>
          <h2>Persistence & Configuration Abuse: Watching the Registry</h2>
          <p>
            The combination of Events <span class="code-tag">12</span>,
            <span class="code-tag">13</span>, and <span class="code-tag">14</span> provides a
            detailed view of registry changes:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="code-tag">12 – RegistryObjectCreate</span> · New key creation</li>
            <li><span class="code-tag">13 – RegistryValueSet</span> · Value modifications</li>
            <li><span class="code-tag">14 – RegistryKeyRename</span> · Renaming of existing keys</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Attackers rely heavily on registry-based persistence via Run keys, service
            configuration, shell hijacking, and scheduled tasks. Tracking this trio of events
            allows SOC teams to detect unauthorised configuration changes that indicate
            persistence, privilege escalation, or system tampering.
          </p>

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">File System & Exfiltration</div>
          <h2>File System & Data Exfiltration: Payloads, Hiding Places, and Cleanup</h2>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 11 – FileCreate</span></h3>
          <p>
            Captures file creation operations. This is invaluable for spotting payload drops,
            staging files, ransomware notes, and other artefacts of malicious activity,
            particularly in locations such as <code>%TEMP%</code>, <code>%APPDATA%</code>, and
            user Downloads folders.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 15 – FileCreateStreamHash</span></h3>
          <p>
            Monitors Alternate Data Streams (ADS) and records a hash of the content. When the
            content is text and small, Sysmon can log the actual text, including metadata such as
            <code>Zone.Identifier</code> with <strong>HostUrl</strong> and
            <strong>ReferrerUrl</strong>. This enables analysts to see the original download
            source for suspicious files and to detect hidden scripts or payloads stored inside ADS.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 23 – FileDelete</span></h3>
          <p>
            Tracks file deletion events. While deletion is common in normal operations, a pattern
            of deletes following malicious executions often indicates anti-forensics behaviour.
            Correlating Event 23 with Events 1, 10, and 11 can reveal attempts to remove tools,
            logs, or artefacts after an attack.
          </p>

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">Discovery & Reconnaissance</div>
          <h2>Discovery & Recon: Mapping the Environment and Data Paths</h2>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 22 – DNSQuery</span></h3>
          <p>
            DNS activity is a critical component of attacker infrastructure. Event 22 logs DNS
            queries at the endpoint level, enabling detection of unusual domains, DGA-style
            patterns, and reconnaissance for external services. When correlated with proxy and
            firewall logs, this event supports strong detection of C2 infrastructure.
          </p>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event IDs 24 / 25 – Clipboard Events</span></h3>
          <p>
            Clipboard capture events can be highly indicative of data theft, especially over RDP
            sessions or during interactive access to sensitive systems. Observing unusual clipboard
            activity on high-value endpoints is an important part of insider threat and data
            exfiltration monitoring.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <div class="section-label">Stealth & Automation</div>
          <h2>Stealth & Automation: WMI as a Fileless Attack Surface</h2>

          <h3><span class="code-tag">Event ID 26 – WMI Event</span></h3>
          <p>
            WMI is a preferred mechanism for fileless persistence, remote execution, and
            automated tasking in advanced intrusions. Event 26 surfaces WMI consumers and filters
            that may be abused by attackers to maintain stealthy, long-term access without
            dropping obvious binaries to disk.

          <p>
            For security operations teams, Sysmon is more than a supplementary log source; it is a
            strategic sensor that, when tuned and operationalised, significantly reduces attacker
            dwell time. Aligning detections with these core event IDs allows SOC analysts to
            prioritise the highest-value telemetry, automate triage, and respond to threats with
            greater accuracy and speed.
